What's your story? I'm a big believer in people doing their own weird thing and owning it completely. I'm in the constant process of becoming the weirdest and truest version of myself.

I'm a marketing nerd--you'll catch me trying to break Facebook's newsfeed algorithm in my spare time. I'm obsessed with podcasts. I could talk to you all day about brunch food. (Alternately, I could eat brunch food all day...Is it brunch time yet?)What might we talk about?Brunch food (ah, we covered that already). Your favorite obscure 80's movie you think should be required viewing. What fountain of youth you think Paul Rudd might be drinking from. The 'catalyst' moments in your life. Self-identity, and how you want to be perceived by others. A time when your belief system shifted permanently. What vulnerability looks like for you, and whether or not you're comfortable embracing that. Naughty phrases in other languages. A debate about the best varieties of cheese. Your favorite childhood snack. Your secret hidden hole-in-the-wall gems in San Francisco (don't worry, I'll keep them a secret too).")

Here are some facts about me.  First, I’m very loyal and lovable, I love to go on car rides.  My foster mom says that I might do best in a quiet home.  I’m good with cats, no worries there.  I do have a wonderful personality according to my foster mom.  I’m neutered and microchipped and up-to-date with all my vaccinations.  I may have limited vision in my left eye but it doesn’t keep me down as I enjoy my life to the fullest.")
