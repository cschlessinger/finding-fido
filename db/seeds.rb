I make a lot of dad jokes, so, I apologize in advance. My goal is to create conversations that strike the balance between goofy and warm, and completely, memorably, nakedly, earnest. What's your story? I'm a big believer in people doing their own weird thing and owning it completely. I'm in the constant process of becoming the weirdest and truest version of myself. I sing a lot, sometimes in my band, but often alone in my apartment simultaneous to trying to teach myself to beatbox (update, day 457: still no success.) I'm a marketing nerd--you'll catch me trying to break Facebook's newsfeed algorithm in my spare time. I'm obsessed with podcasts. I could talk to you all day about brunch food.

Dog.create(breed: "Pug", bio: "Happy-go-lucky and full of energy, the Pug is a vivacious, fun-loving breed, with loads of personality packed into a small package. Pugs are often called \"shadows,\" as they love to glue themselves to their owners’ sides and stay close to the action. While they do have a stubborn streak, they are generally not aggressive, and despite their small frames, they are stout little dogs, making them great pets for families with children. When they are not napping (which happens frequently), Pugs are almost always charming, animated and ready to play (or eat). Pugs do best in homes where they receive plenty of attention and are treated like members of the family, and in turn, they offer heaps of devotion and affection. Activity Requirements Due to their small size and rather lazy nature, Pugs do not require a lot of physical activity to stay healthy and in-shape. A daily walk around the neighborhood or a romp in the backyard should easily meet these dogs’ exercise requirements; in fact, too much exercise can exacerbate Pugs’ tendency to wheeze. While Pugs do love to play, especially with children, it is important to prevent them from jumping off high surfaces like sofas or other furniture, since doing so can cause joint damage. Since they do not require much exercise, Pugs make great companions for those who live in apartments or homes without large backyards, including the elderly. Trainability Since Pugs are stubborn, independent and smart enough to get bored quickly with repetitive exercises, they are not always easy to train. With their silly, distracting antics added to the mix, training a Pug may seem downright impossible at times. Thankfully, Pugs are exceptionally eager to please their owners, and owners who are consistent and patient can usually train their Pugs to exhibit the desired response to his or her prompts. Heaping praise upon them can also help tremendously, since they thrive on attention from their owners. It is also very important that owners do not inadvertently praise behaviors that, while cute, are not the point of the training exercise. This breed is very fond of food and treats, so using treats as rewards may provide some additional motivation for dogs that are especially strong-willed. Working with Pugs during the first six months of their lives is crucial where training is concerned, as it is much more difficult to change dogs’ behaviors after this point. Some owners express concern about how long it takes to house-train Pugs, but puppies of this breed do not develop the muscle strength to control their bowels and bladder completely until they are around 6 months old. As with other commands and skills, Pugs learn to house-train with plenty of positive reinforcement in the form of treats and praise. Behavioral Traits Some Pugs have a tendency to make noise, whether barking, yapping, snorting, grunting or otherwise. Owners can discourage excessive \"yappiness\" with early training, and some Pugs actually make excellent watch dogs, so long as they are trained properly about when barking is appropriate. Pugs love food, and begging can easily get out of hand if family members are in the habit of feeding their dog from the table or offering scraps from plates. It is important that owners only offer treats (especially “people” food) after the dog performs a specified action, like sitting. They can also feed the Pug before the rest of the family eats, which makes the dog less likely to beg. Given Pugs' short statures and tendency to do cute things, it is important that their owners do not inadvertently encourage undesirable behaviors by laughing or giving in to their Pugs' demands." )
Dog.create(breed: "Dalmatian", bio: "The Dalmatian was originally used to guard the carriages and horses of the upper class in the 1800's. While the master was busy, it was the Dalmatian's job to ensure the stock and carriage remained safe and untouched. Later, they became military sentries and circus performers, and most famously the mascots of fire companies. They are a versatile dog, capable of watching over a house or livestock, performing in advanced obedience competitions or simply acting as a loyal family companion. They love to be with people wand will want to be included in all family activities, whether indoor our outdoor. They travel well and love to go for rides in the car. Dalmatians are friendly with people and great with children, though toddlers can often be knocked down by an eager dog. They are great pets for first time dog owners and are generally a joy to live with. Learn More Safety Tips of For Children and Dogs Things to Consider When Exercising with Your Dog Important Behavior Situations Relating to Dogs Activity Requirements Dalmatians are rowdy by nature and never fully outgrow their tendency to jump on people. They need to be exercised often, to keep in-house energy levels from getting out of hand. Not suitable for apartments or a couch-potato lifestyle, Dalmatians like to be outdoors and enjoy going on jogs, running alongside bikes, taking hikes or engaging in agility activities. They love to play with children and can be trusted to endure a bit of rough housing, although toddlers should always be supervised around this rowdy dog. Small children can accidentally get hurt playing with a rowdy Dalmatian. Trainability Dalmatians are highly trainable dogs, and training should always involve positive reinforcement and lots of treats. Harsh treatment will result in fearfulness, as this breed tends to start out on the shy side. Once basic obedience is mastered, Dalmatians should graduate to advanced training, tricks, or agility. They are highly intelligent and thrive on mastering new tasks. Natural show dogs, Dalmatians take well to competition, often excelling in obstacle courses. Behavioral Traits The popularity of Dalmatians exploded with the Disney franchise 101 Dalmatians. Families flocked to the breed, which unfortunately led to a lot of indiscriminate breeding practices. This led to unstable bloodlines. It is important to know a Dalmatian's genetic history before adopting one. While well-bred Dalmatians are a dream to live with, poorly bred dogs can be rife with behavioral and temperament problems including hyperactivity, biting, stubbornness and even aggression. Even a well bred Dalmatian has energy to spare. If not properly exercised and mentally stimulated throughout the day, this breed can become destructive. Additionally, because they love people so much, separation anxiety can develop, which also leads to destructive behavior. A commitment to proper exercise is key to raising a happy, healthy Dalmatian.")
Dog.create(breed: "Alaskan Malamute", bio: "Hardy working dogs, Alaskan Malamutes are really just great big puppies. Though they take their jobs pulling sleds or searching out lost humans very seriously, they love to run, romp and play and have a never-ending energy reserve. Their playful, easy-going nature and friendliness toward strangers makes them a great family companion. Activity Requirements This breed requires a lot of activity in order to stay happy. Malamutes who do not get enough exercise will let their owner know by barking, howling, or becoming destructive. As sled dogs, their endurance is what makes them appealing. They can haul heavy loads for miles, requiring few stops for rest and food. As family dogs, their endurance means Alaskan Malamutes can become a challenge. At least one hour of vigorous exercise per day is recommended for this breed. They should not be kept in a warm climate as they can dehydrate very easily. As the name suggests, this breed hails from the far north, and they love cold weather and playing in the snow. Malamutes should live in a house with a fenced in yard, as their yen for adventure can lead them to scale fences. Families with children should welcome an Alaskan Malamute. They are patient enough to handle children climbing all over them, and energetic enough to keep up with children engaged in rumpus outdoor play. However, small children can be in danger of getting knocked over by a Malamute, so adult supervision is required. Trainability Though they instinctively love to work, Alaskan Malamutes are difficult to train in the home. Independent and willful dogs, a patient, consistent hand is needed when working with this breed. They like to be in charge, so the moment they see an opening to manipulate a situation, Malamutes will take it. Their high endurance level made them the ideal choice for sled races and northern expeditions. Admiral Byrd famously used Alaskan Malamutes in his North Pole expeditions because of their high energy and endurance levels. They are also used in search and rescue missions across the north, including avalanche missions. Behavioral Traits Howling is guaranteed when an Alaskan Malamute is left alone, so families who live in close proximity to other people should think twice about adopting one. Separation anxiety is also common, as the Malamute loves to be with his people. Proper exercise and activity will prevent this problem from growing. Food aggression is also common in the Alaskan Malamute, and difficult to train out of them. Children should be taught never to disturb this dog while he is eating.")
Dog.create(breed: "Australian Shepherd", bio: "Personality traits of the Australian Shepherd vary from dog to dog. Some can be outgoing and friendly, while others are shy and reserved. Regardless of the individual dog's personality, a few things remain constant. Aussies are highly intelligent, loyal, and thrive on human companionship. Aussies are at their best when they are engaged in interaction with a person, whether it be walking, running, or fetching; and are the perfect companion for an active family. Activity Requirements Australian Shepherds need a lot of physical activity. They are a working breed, so they thrive on learning new tasks and engaging in those tasks as often as possible. Families who are active outdoors will benefit from the company of an Aussie. They are incredibly agile and enjoy games like fetch and catching a frisbee. Apartment dwellers should be cautioned against adopting an Australian Shepherd. Though they are medium in size, they require a lot of exercise and stimulation, and if they don't get it, can become destructive or develop separation anxiety. Trainability One of the most intelligent breeds, Australian Shepherds can be trained to do just about any task put before them. A firm hand is not needed to train this breed; positive reinforcement works just fine. They are a people-pleasing breed and quickly learn behaviors that are consistently rewarded with praise, or a small treat. Aussies excel in simple obedience training, and once they have mastered the basics should be enrolled in an advanced course, or more appropriately, agility training. Training should begin early with Aussies, as their herding instinct can take over and cause havoc. Without setting proper boundaries with this breed, they can try to herd other pets or even children. They should also be socialized as early as possible, as they have a tendency to be standoffish or even aggressive to strangers. Behavioral Traits Australian Shepherds crave human companionship and love being included in all family activity. The flip side to this is that they can easily develop separation anxiety or barking behaviors. Early training, plenty of exercise and mental activity can keep these problems from developing. Their herding nature can cause Aussies to be chasers or nippers. They will chase birds, rabbits, cats, bikes, and even cars. Australian Shepherds should be closely supervised if not on a leash, or in a fenced yard, to avoid potentially dangerous situations.")
Dog.create(breed: "American Eskimo Dog", bio: "Happy and always energetic, the American Eskimo dog loves to run, play, learn new tasks and solve problems. As the name suggests, this breed especially loves playing in the snow, so they make a perfect companion for families who live in cooler climates. They are vigilant, with a keen ear, and make excellent watchdogs. They are patient and loving with children, and their good nature make them a fine match for first-time dog owners. Activity Requirements The American Eskimo Dog needs a lot of exercise and play time. They are intelligent and creative problem-solvers so if they don't get enough activity, they can find creative (and often destructive) ways to entertain themselves when the family is away. This dog is best suited for families with fenced-in yards and plenty of room to run. Apartment-dwelling folks will find their American Eskimo will become bored, depressed and constructive. The American Eskimo Dog is good with children, and will happily engage in playtime with them. They can be rambunctious, so parents should keep an eye on small children, so they don't get knocked over. Trainability This breed is easily trainable, and famous for learning tricks, but if they sense they can gain a bit of control, they will take it. Confident leadership is necessary to keep the chain of command in tact with this breed. Their high intelligence can also make them manipulative, so “pushover” parents beware. Positive reinforcement is the best method to employ when training and American Eskimo Dog, and once basic obedience training is complete, they should be enrolled in advanced courses to keep their minds stimulated. They do not need to be trained as watchdogs, as they will inherently protect their territory, but unlike other breeds, they rarely develop aggression. Even so, they should be socialized at an early age, just to be safe. Behavioral Traits Barking is common among American Eskimo Dogs, especially when left alone. Their bark is very high pitched and can be an annoyance to neighbors. They also bark at the sight of any oncoming person or object. They can be trained to obey a stop barking command, but rarely can the desire to start barking be trained out of them. Because they crave companionship, American Eskimo Dogs can develop separation anxiety. Ensuring he has enough exercise and activities to keep him busy while the family is away, can prevent this problem from developing.")
Dog.create(breed: "Siberian Husky", bio: "According to the AKC Standard, the Siberian Husky does not display the possessive qualities of the guard dog, nor is he overly suspicious of strangers or aggressive with other dogs. Their exotic, wolf-like appearance makes Huskies appealing to many people, and their even temperament, love of other dogs and indifference to strangers makes them ideal family dogs. Huskies have a zest for life that is unmatched by few breeds. Every time a Husky is outside, it's as if it's his first time and well into adulthood Huskies play with the vigor of a puppy. They may seem like a good family dog for first time dog owners, but Huskies can often be “too much dog” for a novice. They require extensive training and exercise in order maintain good behavior and only those with the time and energy to fully commit to a Husky should take on this breed. But Husky owners agree, you get out of a Siberian Husky what you put into him, and these reliable dogs are worth the effort. Activity Requirements Siberian Huskies need a lot of vigorous activity in order to maintain health and happiness. They were developed as sled dogs, which means they have energy and endurance to spare, so adopting a Husky means adopting an active lifestyle. This breed enjoys long walks, hikes, jogs and bike rides. In the yard they can play fetch for hours, and some even like to play frisbee. Huskies will feel as though they died and went to heaven when at the dog park with other dogs to run, romp and wrestle with. Their medium size makes Siberian Huskies appealing to apartment dwellers, but this may not be the best living situation for a Husky. They are rowdy and rambunctious well into adulthood and need plenty of room to move about. Trainability Husky owners claim their dogs have the ability to perform at the top of their obedience classes, but when they come home they ignore everything they learned, only to turn it back on again when they return to the next class. This breed is notoriously difficult to train and are generally not well suited for first time owners. Huskies require firm leadership and 100% consistency when it comes to boundaries and rule enforcement. Their expressive eyes can be used to manipulate the softies of the house, so all family members must also be “trained” to be consistent with rules and leadership. Behavioral Traits The popularity of the breed has led to indiscriminate breeding of the Siberian Husky, and there are many dogs being born into blood lines with uneven temperaments. When adopting a Husky, it is important to do extensive research on breeders, and if you get your Husky from a rescue, the organization should provide you with as much information as possible. Well bred Huskies should never be aggressive or overly shy and timid. Huskies are notorious escape artists, managing to foil fences, screen doors, garages and other holding devices. You should never leave your Husky unsupervised in the yard or with only a screen separating him from the wild blue yonder.")
Dog.create(breed: "Golden Retriever", bio: "The Golden Retriever is the classic family companion. They are obedient, playful, intelligent, well-mannered, great with kids, and kindly to strangers. They are good watchdogs, but make lousy guard dogs as they love people far too much to be effective. Golden Retrievers are always at the top of their obedience classes and are often the champions of sporting competitions. Hunters find them to be reliable bird dogs, and their keen sense of smell and desire to work alongside people makes them sought-after narcotics sniffers. Golden Retrievers need people and are best suited for large, active families. Activity Requirements Golden Retrievers need a lot of exercise, but not as much as other Retrievers and their activity requirements can be met with a couple of daily walks and tossing a stick in the yard. They enjoy pretty much any outdoor activity their people participate in, whether walking, running, hiking, biking, swimming or playing chase with kids. Though they are naturally even tempered and don't need hours of exercise, their large size makes them unsuitable for apartments. They need a lot of room to move around, and confinement is unfair to a Golden Retriever. Trainability Golden Retrievers are a breeze to train. They are people-pleasers and will do anything for a bit of praise and some food. This makes them an excellent choice for first-time dog owners. Goldens should always be treated with a gentle hand, as they are sensitive creatures who don't respond well to harsh tones and discipline. The biggest problem people have in training this breed is walking on a leash. They should be taught proper leash etiquette early on, otherwise they can – and will – pull on a leash. Their trainability has made them a number once choice for service and therapy dogs, and in recent years they have been a favorite choice of police forces, who utilize them as drug and bomb sniffers and in search and rescue teams. Behavioral Traits While Golden Retrievers are generally even-tempered and well behaved, potential owners should do their research before settling on a breeder. Goldens are popular, and this has led to indiscriminate breeding practices which means puppies with unstable temperaments. All the exercise and socialization in the world can't undo a bad bloodline, so always adopt from a reputable breeder. This is a social breed of dog who adores people and thrives on companionship. If left alone too long, especially without proper exercise, Golden Retrievers can develop Separation Anxiety which usually means destructive chewing. In fact, well-adjusted Goldens are big chewers, so they must be provided with plenty of their own chew toys and bones, otherwise they will run off with shoes, books, pillows and other household items.")
Dog.create(breed: "German Shepherd", bio: "The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) is perhaps best known as the strong, courageous and obedient guide dog for the disabled and service dog of police K-9 and search-and-rescue units, valued for its tenacity, intelligence, loyalty and focus. GSDs are often sought as guard dogs and protectors. However, while they are first and foremost a herding breed, GSDs can make outstanding, loving family companions. German Shepherds have a rather distinct personality marked by a direct and fearless expression, obvious self-confidence and reluctance to develop indiscriminate friendships. They tend to be indifferent to strangers and can be aloof; however, once they befriend you, their devotion is life-long. German Shepherds can be as energetic as they are large, although they should be of even disposition and unflappable, with a restrained, composed and confident temperament. They should be patient, attentive, faithful and determined. They can be bold but should not be unnecessarily aggressive. They do not require an enormous amount of daily exercise, but they certainly are not the ideal breed for apartment dwellers or people who live alone and work long hours. They tend to bond well with children and enjoy participating in family activities like hiking, swimming, picnicking, running and the like. Farmers are often partial to German Shepherds because of their great intelligence, solid herding skills and seemingly endless energy. Regular walks will suit most GSDs just fine; many also enjoy off-leash romps in secure dog parks. They are particularly well suited to obedience training. To combat boredom, mental exercise is excellent for the GSD. They are extremely intelligent and, like many other breeds, enjoy working with their owners. German Shepherds thrive in advanced obedience work and on agility courses. They also can thrive with regular games of fetch with a stick, ball or Frisbee. German Shepherds can be trained to do almost any task set before them. They are smart, bold, alert, and single-minded when necessary and eager to please their people. They are powerful but still agile. While highly trainable, they should be socialized and trained young in life. This requires a firm, consistent and kind handler. German Shepherds frequently project dominance if they feel that they can get away with it, which is unacceptable in a companion animal living in a world filled with dogs, cats, children and other distractions. GSDs are protective by nature, which is why they make excellent guard dogs and police dogs. Once a GSD bonds with its family, it may become protective of them when approached by strangers or by friends. This protectiveness may be appropriate or inappropriate, depending upon the situation, and the dog may not always be able to discriminate between those situations. It is important to train GSDs to recognize welcome and unwelcome guests. They may bark as strangers or familiar friends approach your home, but proper socialization and training from an early age will help this very intelligent and proud breed to become well-integrated into a normal social routine. Neither aggression nor timidity should be tolerated. Reputable breeders and trainers generally agree that aggressive tendencies or excessive shyness in GSDs usually are a product of poor breeding, poor training, or both. Potential GSD owners should explore their dog's background and commit to an appropriate socialization and training protocol before making a life-long commitment to the dog. A German Shepherd Dog can provide years of loyal companionship and faithful service. Because of their size, trainability, self-confidence and poise, proper training and socializing is very important. People without the time or dedication to commit to really working with their German Shepherd should perhaps select a different breed. Those who are willing to devote the time and energy to train their GSD properly will find their investment returned tenfold in a well-adjusted, loyal family companion.")
Dog.create(breed: "Labrador Retriever", bio: "Loyal, loveable, happy and friendly to all he meets, the Labrador Retriever is the number one registered dog in the AKC. Labs are full of energy and will run to the door to greet you (or anyone, for that matter) as if you'd just returned from a year-long trip. They are truly “man's best friend,” and are at their happiest when engaged in family activities. They love running, hiking, swimming and playing fetch for hours on end and are extremely patient with children of all ages. Labs are a breeze to train, and as long as you are prepared to live with puppy-like behavior well into adulthood, they make an excellent choice for first time dog owners. Labrador Retrievers have energy to spare and are not well suited for couch potatoes. They are also rather large and clumsy, so apartments are not the best living arrangements for this breed. Homes with yards and lots of room to romp are the most ideal setting to raise a Lab. Walking a Lab is a good start for daily exercise, but a simple stroll around the block is not going to fulfill their daily exercise requirement. These dogs need to run every day in order to burn off excess energy, and if they aren't properly exercised they will become destructive. A bored Lab will chew anything he can get his mouth on. Labs are thrilled to accompany you on jogs or to run alongside a bicycle. Playing in the yard with children can keep them busy for hours on end. Hunters can take Labs out into the field to retrieve, and they can handle icy water temperatures with ease. Swimming pool owners be warned: you'll have a hard time getting your Labrador out of the water. If the pool is open, he'll want to swim. Labradors are a breeze to train. They possess a strong desire to please and will do anything for some affection and a treat or two. Some owners find them to be a challenge because they are so rambunctious, but the key is to start them off as puppies and keep training interesting and fun. Labs love to play, and if they think training is a game, will participate with great earnest. Training should start early, as Labs grow quickly and if they don't have basic commands mastered early on, can be too large to reign in. They also behave like puppies for many years, so patience is an absolute must with a Lab. No matter how obedient they are, they simply can't help themselves but to jump and bounce, so “down” and “stay” should be understood early on. Once basic obedience is mastered, Labs can graduate on to advanced training or agility activities. They are not as reliable on an agility course as a Golden Retriever may be, but they love the exercise and enjoy spending time with people and other dogs. Chewing and mouthing is a common problem among Labradors. You will need to keep lots of chew toys and bones on hand in order to save your furniture and shoes. They like to greet returning family members and visitors with a trophy in their mouth, as well, so keep an eye on anything within his reach that is not tacked down. Exercising your lab before you leave the house and providing him with lots of bones is a must if you don't want to come home and find couches destroyed. Labs are famous for being clumsy. They will run and slide around on wood floors, back into tables, knock over lamps and whip drinks with their tails. This clumsiness is doesn't go away until the dog is well past adolescence and is hard to overcome. “Stay” and “down” commands can help, but a young Lab is often described as a bull in a China shop.")
Dog.create(breed: "Chihuahua", bio: "Small and sassy, the Chihuahua is the tiniest of all dog breeds, often weighing in at less than four pounds. Their personalities are varied, ranging from shy and timid to plucky and outgoing. All Chihuahuas are fiercely loyal to the people they love, and eat up as much attention as they can get. They will often posture toward bigger dogs, barking their little hearts out, but always seem to recognize and welcome the company of other Chihuahuas. They tolerate being dressed up, and in the winter time will welcome the warmth of a sweater. Some have a reputation for being quite mean to strangers, but this stems from their protective of their owner and the fact that the only defense mechanisms they have are their bark and their teeth. They are an economical companion, as they don't eat much, and are a good choice for first-time dog owners. All Chihuahua owners agree that this breed is an endless source of laughs. Their big eyes and ears, combined with an uncanny ability to cause mischief, provide hours of entertainment for the entire family. They also love to be warm. They will follow the sun's rays around the house all day, and when the sun goes down will burrow into couches, chairs, blankets and laps in order to stay cozy. Chihuahuas don't need a lot of vigorous activity, so they are well suited for apartments and condominiums. Despite their size, they should be walked daily because it is easy to end up with an obese Chihuahua. The ease of training a Chihuahua depends upon the dog itself, and it's own particular bloodline. Whereas some dogs can be trained out of fearfulness, timidity, aggression or rowdy behavioral, a Chihuahua's temperament is determined solely on his genetics. If he comes from high-struck parents, he will be high-strung. If he comes from an easy-going, friendly line, he'll be the same. Regardless of the individual dog's personality, training should be consistent, involve lots of positive reinforcement, and plenty of treats. Treating a dog this size with a harsh hand will only cause problems. Chihuahuas are notoriously hard to house train, and many owners resort to litter boxes or indoor grass patches. They hate cold weather and despise the rain, and many times will flat out refuse to relieve themselves in such conditions. Barking is the number one behavioral problem with Chihuahuas. Even easy going individuals who enjoy the company of new people will bark to announce that person's arrival. Some Chihuahuas are prone to bark literally every time a house guest makes a move, which can be alienating to friends and family. It is very important to socialize Chihuahuas as early and as often as possible, so that they are welcoming of new people.")
Dog.create(breed: "Shiba Inu", bio: "Shiba Inus are alert dogs with fiery personalities. Many owners call their Shibas little “spark plugs” because they are so spunky. Owning a Shiba Inu means committing to plenty of exercise and lots of intensive training and socialization. These three ingredients are essential to raising a well-adjusted Shiba with good manners. Shibas love their families and will want to be included in all activities both indoors and out. They are good with children, though toddlers may not make the best siblings for a Shiba. They prefer the company older kids who understand how to behave around dogs. For experienced dog owners, Shibas can be loving, affectionate companions, as this is a breed who truly gives back what his family is willing to put in. Activity Requirements Shiba Inus require a lot of vigorous activity to maintain health and and even temperament. They may be appealing to apartment dwellers because of their medium build and unique look, but Shiba Inus need several walks a day and plenty of time to run. Because they are dog aggressive, parks are not always the best places for Shibas, so homes with fenced yards are the ideal living space. Shibas enjoy interactive games and will happily chase balls and search out hidden toys in the back yard for hours. The most ideal activity for a well-behaved Shiba is the agility course, as their minds are just as active as their little bodies, and boredom can set in quickly. A bored Shiba is a destructive Shiba, so keeping him occupied can save your shoes and furniture. Trainability Shibas can be difficult to train, especially for dog owners. Many breeders recommend working with a professional dog trainer who understands the Shiba personality and temperament. They are dominant dogs who like to be in charge and will make you work for your position as leader. A calm-assertive demeanor is important, as is generous praise, treats, and 100% consistency. If you give a Shiba Inu any leeway to bend the rules, he will walk all over you. Once leadership has been established and basic obedience has been mastered, Shibas should graduate on to an advanced activity like agility training. They are smart animals who like to use their minds as well as their bodies, and they will appreciate the opportunity to bond with someone they love. Socialization should begin early with your Shiba Inu so that he does not grow up to be mistrustful of strangers. The strong temperament of the Shiba Inu gives them a bad reputation in some circles, but when a commitment is made to properly train, socialize and exercise a Shiba Inu, they are very well-mannered dogs. The consensus among breeders is that ill behaved or aggressive Shibas are a result of poor training. Behavioral Traits Shiba Inus are prone to dog aggression. Properly socializing your Shiba around other dogs can minimize this, but it is best to keep him on a leash at all times, especially if your male is not neutered. They are also prone to chasing cats, so it's best that Shibas not live with a feline, and caged rodents will be terrorized by a Shiba Inu constantly stalking. This breed is very possessive of toys and food. Shibas are good with kids, but when small children are around, it is best to hide your dog's toys. If a stranger takes something that is his, he won't be happy and can respond by snapping. Separation Anxiety is a common trait in Shibas, but is most commonly caused by lack of exercise. Before leaving the house for long periods of time, you should wear your Shiba Inu out with a long walk or a run in the park. This breed expresses their anxiety through excessive barking or screaming and very destructive chewing.")
Dog.create(breed: "Cocker Spaniel", bio: "Outgoing, sociable and almost uniformly happy, the American Cocker Spaniel is an extremely popular family pet. These are charming, sturdy little dogs that originally were bred to flush and retrieve birds on land. Many of them are still used for that purpose. However, their best role is that of a beloved family member. This sweet, easygoing breed loves children and usually gets along quite well with other dogs and even cats, provided that proper socialization takes place. Because American Cocker Spaniels tend to welcome friends, family and foe in the same fashion, they do not typically make good watchdogs. However, they are loyal, endearing companions that crave - and thrive on - human attention. They also are quite portable, given their modest size, which makes them great travel partners. The American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest of the Sporting Breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. Although they are not large dogs, they are energetic, active and playful. They thoroughly enjoy going on hikes, swimming and participating in other activities with their human family-members. This is a highly adaptable breed that can live quite comfortably in apartments or condominiums, as long as their owners give them enough exercise. A long, brisk daily walk is often enough for an older Cocker Spaniel. However, younger animals will need more activity, either in the form of walks, romps at the dog park, playing in the yard with other companion animals or playing fetch with their owners. American Cocker Spaniels are natural retrievers and usually are more than willing to chase a ball and bring it back for as long as their owner cares to toss it. It is important for owners of this breed to keep their dogs active and engage. A Cocker that is left to his own devices is likely to become bored and eventually destructive, as he tries to find ways to entertain himself. American Cocker Spaniels are intelligent dogs that love to please their people and are easy to train. As with almost any breed, it is important that Cockers are socialized correctly starting at an early age. These are extremely sensitive, affectionate animals that are best trained using positive reinforcement and gentle, patient repetition of commands. Short training sessions several times a day are better than a single prolonged session. Owners should concentrate on getting their Cocker to master one basic command, before moving on to another one. Housebreaking can be difficult for this breed. Crate training usually makes potty training much easier. Flushing and retrieving birds come naturally to most American Cocker Spaniels, without the need for any advanced or specialized training. They also excel in competitive dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, flyball, hunting tests, field trials and many others. Well-behaved Cocker Spaniels also make exceptional therapy dogs. Because the blood of generations of hunting dogs courses through the veins of American Cocker Spaniels, they are particularly alert to the presence of birds and other small animals. As a result, owners should not let their Cocker off-leash, unless the dog is thoroughly trained in obedience and has a rock-solid recall, because he might become distracted and try to chase any nearby moving creature. Some Cocker Spaniels have a tendency to be a bit aggressive, or a bit shy. Generally, this is due to inadequate socialization at a young age. The most important period for correctly socializing this breed is when the dog is 2-5 months old. During this key time, the owner should expose the dog to lots of new people and new situations in a positive, non-threatening manner. Children must be taught to treat the dog gently and affectionately, so that he learns to trust them. When a young American Cocker Spaniel is carefully introduced to new people, places and things, he usually learns to accept them readily and becomes a happy, trusting, gentle family companion.")
Dog.create(breed: "American Pit Bull Terrier", bio: "Pit Bull Terriers come with a huge stigma – they are famous for being viscous fighting dogs, and evening news programs often highlight stories of Pit Bull attacks. Shelters are overrun with Pit Bulls, entire cities have banned the breed, and saying the name “Pit Bull” can strike fear into the hearts of some people. But a well bred Pit Bull who lives in a loving, caring home is the opposite of the “killer” splashed around on television. Pit Bulls are loving, loyal, clown dogs who make excellent companions or those with active lifestyles. They love being with people and want to be included in all family activities whether it's a ride in the car, a neighborhood stroll or a romp in the park. While it's true that in the wrong hands, Pit Bulls can be viscous, in the right hands, Pit Bulls can be sweethearts, which many owners describe as babies in a dog's body. Pit Bulls need a lot of vigorous exercise and are happiest when they are active. Long walks, short runs, or playing long games of ball in the back yard will meet their daily activity requirements. If a Pit Bull Terrier is not getting enough exercise, they are sure to let you know. They are notoriously destructive, making easy work of flower beds or expensive furniture, and some develop the neurotic behavior of obsessively chasing their own tail. Apartments or condos may not be the best homes for this breed, as they are rowdy and rambunctious and have been lovingly referred to as the proverbial “bull in a China shop.” Training should be started early and always done in calm-assertive manner, as they won't respond to discipline or harsh tones. Training is best done in short sessions due to Pit Bull Terriers' short attention span and they will quickly become uninterested, even if treats are used as a reward. Lots of patience is necessary when working with a Pit Bull Terrier, as training can be a long process. Even after a Bull Terrier is fully trained, they may decide to test their boundaries as they get older and project dominance. These situations should be handled with calm assertion; like a teenager, they just want to see what they can get away with. Families with children should socialize puppies early on to accept outside children as welcome guests. While Pit Bull Terriers will bond nicely with kids in their own family, they can sometimes be aggressive to to other children and should be taught early on that all kids are to be welcomed with open arms. Separation Anxiety develops often in Pit Bulls. It is important that this breed get enough exercise throughout the day and have enough activities to keep them busy when left alone, or they will become destructive. Some Pit Bull Terriers need to be crated well into adulthood to keep them (and the house furniture) safe when left alone. Animal aggression is very common in Pit Bulls. Their fighting roots are still present in many lines, and even if they are raised alongside cats or other dogs, there is no guarantee that they won't go after them one day. Even the most easy going Pit Bulls will not back down from a challenge. They may not start fights, but they will finish them. It is very important that when you take your Pitt Bull to the dog park that you closely supervise his activity, and remove him from the park immediately if other dogs are targeting him. Remember, your Pit Bull is an ambassador for the breed. They should also be leashed at all times, and your yard should be fenced. Isolating a Pitt Bull is never a good idea. Socialize your Pit Bull from an early age so that he is accepting of new people and new situations, otherwise he will become naturally wary, which can lead to problems in adulthood. They are generally happy, easy going animals, and as long as they come from a reputable breeder and have polite parents, you can feel confident that your Pit Bull will be an excellent ambassador for the breed.")
Dog.create(breed: "Pomeranian", bio: "Pomeranians weigh about five pounds but they have the personalities of something a lot larger. They are curious dogs, alert and interested in everything that is going on around them. Often, their favorite spot at home is perched on a windowsill where they can take in as much neighborhood action as they can, barking often to let you know that someone is walking by. They love to be the center of attention, and have been known to behave mischievously in order to garner the attention they crave. Poms are very well suited for active seniors who can devote all of their time and energy to their dog. Pomeranians can live happily in homes of all sizes. They are small enough to live in apartments or condos, but active enough to flourish in a large home. They should be walked daily to burn off energy, and this helps maintain temperament. They enjoy running, so some yard time every week will be welcome. Poms need to keep their minds active. They are smart dogs and if left to their own devices will get into mischief, so to keep them happy many owners enroll their Pomeranians in agility training to keep both mind and body in tip top shape. Poms are notoriously difficult to train. They like to be the boss and don't take kindly to someone telling them what to do. They are stubborn, bossy, manipulative and require gentle but firm leadership. It can be easy to back off of training because they are so small and they can charm the pants off even the most heard-hearted trainer, but consistency is the key to training. Poms don't have to be unruly; they can be trained and socialized to be well-mannered. Food is an excellent motivational tool, as is lots of happy, exuberant praise. Keep training sessions short, but never let your Pom decide when it's time to pack it in. Early socialization is also important in raising a well-mannered Pomeranian. They are naturally standoffish around strangers, and this can easily get out of hand and become fearfulness or even aggression. You must teach your Pom as a puppy that new people, new animals, and new situations are exciting adventures. Once leadership is established and basic obedience has been mastered, Poms can do well on the agility course. They are spry little dogs who like to use their brains, and while they can be stubborn they will eat up the extra bonding time with you, and will enjoy the physical exercise. Pomeranians are not recommended for families with small children. They are possessive of their toys and food and can snap or bite toddlers who do not understand how to respect a dog's boundaries. They demand a lot of attention and can become resentful of children who may take the focus away from them. It can be easy to shelter a Pomeranian because of their tiny size, but sheltering your Pom is not a good idea. Over-sheltered Pomeranians can become very high strung. It is important to give your Pomeranian independence. Let him walk on a leash rather than tote him around in a bag and socialize him around people and other animals so that he knows how to greet and be greeted with proper manners. Pomeranians bark at everything and everybody and it can be difficult to train this tendency out of them. Socialization and proper exercise can help, but the consensus among Pom owners is that this is a yappy dog and patience is required to own one.")
Dog.create(breed: "Great Dane", bio: "The Great Dane is an enormous breed that has been cultivated as a distinct type of dog for hundreds of years. Great Danes originated in Germany and perhaps in England (there is no known connection with Denmark), and were bred to hunt the savage European wild boar. This took a powerful, intelligent, tenacious and fearless dog, and the Great Dane’s personality and breed characteristics suited him perfectly to this task. However, size and beauty alone were never enough to make the “Apollo of dogs” a suitable representative of his distinguished breed; he always needed height, weight, courage, nobility, speed and endurance as well. Danes are rarely used as boarhounds today, but instead have transitioned to beloved and affectionate companions and less commonly, estate guard dogs. As such, balance in temperament and physical traits is essential. According to the AKC Official Standard, a Great Dane “must be spirited, courageous, never timid; always friendly and dependable. This physical and mental combination is the characteristic which gives the Great Dane the majesty possessed by no other breed.” While developed as a true working breed, correctly-bred Great Danes make outstanding, affectionate, loving and trusted family companions for spacious households that want a large, short-haired dog that offers some manner of protection due to their sheer size. They tend to be protective by nature only if necessary, but Great Danes should never be encouraged to be overly protective and certainly never to be aggressive. Many people are terrified of large dogs irrespective of their kind temperament. To keep these dogs as gentle ambassadors of this giant breed, Dane owners should always be vigilant and keep their dogs under complete control when in public, and securely contained when at home. Great Danes can be as energetic as they are large, especially during the teenage period. Young Danes are prone to “the zoomies” – a term used to describe their demonstration of wild abandon and sheer glee that involves galloping, leaping, spinning and jumping on or over objects with an endearing expression of pure joy. This is entertaining to watch, unless a person or prized possession is in their path, which it rarely is but certainly could be. Because of its size, strength and inherently playful nature, even the most well-mannered Great Dane should not be left unsupervised with small children, and all children in the household must be taught the correct way to interact with and respect a dog. Danes are truly house dogs, despite their size, and generally do not require an enormous amount of daily exercise. Indeed, as they are so rapidly-growing, young Great Danes should not be taken jogging or otherwise exercised excessively during the first 1-2 years of life to prevent bone and joint disorders that can be caused by overuse. Danes do not thrive being kept isolated, kenneled or crated for long hours at a time, although they typically do require a securely fenced yard for exercise, elimination and playtime. They usually bond well with all friends and family members and enjoy participating in family activities. Regular walks suit most Great Danes perfectly. Danes are described as being of average intelligence in the dog world but typically are easy to housebreak and train to standard obedience commands such as sit, stay, down, come and heel. As a breed, they have a strong desire to please. Many Great Danes compete very successfully in obedience, agility, rally and other performance competitions, in addition to being successfully shown in the AKC conformation ring. Early training and socialization of puppies is essential from 3-6 months of age. Dane puppies grow extremely rapidly and within no time will tower over their canine compatriots in puppy kindergarten classes. In its first year of life, a Great Dane will grow as much as a child grows in fourteen or fifteen years. They must be given consistent structure and gentle but firm training to help them become the beloved, devoted and well-adjusted family-members that they are so well-known to be. Dane puppies should not be allowed free run of the house without supervision until they have proven themselves to be trustworthy, as they can easily destroy a couch, chair or carpeting if the mood suits them. Many owners responsibly crate-train their puppies which, when done properly, can help enormously with potty training and prevention of chewing sprees. Many Dane puppies see small animals and human toddlers as peers - similar in size and sound as themselves. Puppies naturally play aggressively, chew on each other, growl and nip as part of learning appropriate canine pack structure and behavior. Owners of Danes need to conscientiously and consistently watch and train their puppies so that they respect all household members and understand their role in the home. Children should not bother a puppy when it is in its safe place or den – which most commonly is its crate. Anyone considering adding a Great Dane (or any other giant breed) to their family should be especially careful to research the breed and the breeder whose dogs she is considering. Spur-of-the-moment decisions to acquire a Great Dane puppy are too often made by people unprepared to deal with their massive size, rambunctiousness and potentially destructive behavior, especially during adolescence. Reputable breeders will take the time to discuss the temperament of their breed with potential owners in an attempt to prevent their dogs from ending up in shelters or with rescue organizations. Knowledgeable breeders and trainers generally agree that aggressive tendencies or excessive shyness/fearfulness in Great Danes usually are a product of poor breeding, poor training, or both. Potential owners should explore their dog's background and commit to an appropriate training and socialization protocol before making a life-long commitment to this giant dog. Owners of Danes should have a securely fenced yard or enclosure to prevent theft of or escape by their dog. Most Danes are not jumpers by nature; a six-foot fence should be sufficient. Many Great Danes have a fairly high prey-drive and will chase cats, rabbits or other small animals. Danes left alone for hours on end may become barkers, which nearby neighbors tend not to appreciate due to the depth and volume of the Great Dane bark. A Great Dane can provide years of affectionate and loyal companionship. People without the time or dedication to commit to their Great Dane should consider selecting a different breed.")
