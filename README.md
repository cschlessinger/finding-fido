With Valentine's Day in the air, we had love on our minds: puppy love. Over ~29 hours (including sleep!), our hackathon team used the IBM Watson Personality Insights API to analyze descriptions of dog breeds and score their Big 5 traits. Users looking to adopt input a bio, which is similarly analyzed and scored. After suggesting which breeds have personalities that mesh best with yours, we pull in pups in need of loving homes from the Petfinder database. So go put that OkCupid profile to a far more fruitful purpose and find your Fido!
